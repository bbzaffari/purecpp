# 🏗️ Sandbox Repository

This repository is a **sandbox environment** for testing and prototyping.

* Every time it is compiled (e.g., using the commands `all_cmake.sh` or `module_cmake.sh <module>`),
  the outputs are **redirected** to the `Sandbox/` directory.

* Here, the `.so` files (shared libraries) will be available
  for experimentation, prototyping, and testing purposes.
